            Astrology is a predictive science with its own sets of methods, claims and findings that have forever inspired and allowed people with
            insights into different aspects of their life. Astrology, with its wows and hows, is contentful and approving enough to make people a believer
            of the same. And thankfully, it continues to do so despite the world shifting bases from what they believe in and what they don&apos;t.

            If one has to go into the technicalities of astrology, it is the study of different cosmic objects, which are usually stars and planets, that have
            an effect on the lives of the people. You must be aware that there are as many as 8 planets in the solar system. However, if I ask an online
            astrologer near me about the planets in astrology, they will tell me that there are as many as 9 planets in astrology also called Navagrahas.
            And surprisingly, the planet Earth, in astrology, is not counted among the nine planets.

            The 9 planets in astrology are Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati), Venus (Shukra), Saturn
            (Shani), Rahu (north node of the moon), and Ketu (south node of the moon).
